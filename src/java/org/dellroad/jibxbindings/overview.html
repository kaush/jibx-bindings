This is the API documentation for version <strong>@VERSION@</strong> of the
<a href="http://jibx-bindings.googlecode.com/"><b>jibx-bindings</b></a> Java library.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>jibx-bindings</strong> project seeks to provide a library
of Java classes and their corresponding pre-compiled JiBX bindings
for various common public XML document formats.
</p>

<p>
By including JiBX along with the appropriate pre-compiled binding
JARs from <strong>jibx-bindings</strong>, your application is all
set up for fast and efficient conversion between XML and Java.
</p>

<p>
While the pre-compiled concrete bindings in <strong>jibx-bindings</strong>
provide immediately usable code, all of the binding modules in
jibx-bindings are designed using modular abstract mapping definitions,
so you can easily define new bindings that pull from existing XML
schemas simply by including these definitions in your own binding.
